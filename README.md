**Programming Language Theory** - is the most interesting branch of Computer Science for me. Because the expressivness of language - of natural, and programming, and formal, and others - is beautiful in itself and allows us to say, and to create, and to save something meaningful.

Helpful resources collected here for study sub-disciplines of PLT, such as Formal Semantics, Type Theory, Category Theory (from programmer perspective), Lambda Calculus and Compiler Construction.
